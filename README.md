# Project Introduction

## What is Gaia Protocol?

Gaia Protocol is an investment-purposed Klaytn network PFP NFT project by combining Defi 2.0 and NFT concepts. The project deposits 50% of all minted Klay permanently on Kronos DAO, the first Defi 2.0 initiative on Klaytn network. The compound interest generated from the deposit will be distributed to the NFT holders. We have a prospective mission to create a proactive community with enthusiasts in both DeFi 2.0 and NFT investment, with information exchange as well as various internal events exclusively for our community members.

## What is the goal of Gaia Protocol?

The project goal is to make Gaia Protocol a passive income for the holders through receiving interests after they exceed the break-even point of the initial investment on the project. Gaia Protocol's minting process will embark on February 10th, 2022. Half of the minting price will be staked on Defi 2.0 permanently. Holders can easily claim their interests on the project website. Due to the importance of compounding interest in Defi 2.0, frequent interest claiming may prolong the time needed to reach the break-even point of the investment. Another goal of the project is to build a strong and attractive community for the holders. It will become a major community for NFT & Crypto investors for making potential profits through exclusive information sharing among the holders. Such an interactive community will be beneficial to members and appreciate the value of the Gaia Protocol. The growth of the Gaia Protocol community will not only increase the investment in the Klaytn network but also help to expand the Klaytn ecosystem eventually.

## Why Kronos DAO was selected as a strategic partner among Klatyn Defi 2.0 projets?

Kronos DAO is the first Defi 2.0 on the Klaytn network. Since their first launch on November 18th, 2021, Kronos DAO has recorded over 110 million USD TVL. Kronos team showed stable project operation, refined community management, and proactive marketing and promotion. sKrono holders showed loyalty to the community which led to the continuous development of the Kronos Project. As the Gaia team showed the excelled performance and potential expansion, the team proceeded KYC with the Kronos team to build up the partnership. Through the partnership, Gaia Protocol enables relatively stable compounding interest to the holders. Furthermore, as the team deposits a significant amount of assets at Kronos DAO, we will be the largest holder of KRNO governance token. This means that Gaia Protocol will contribute to the stability of Kronos DAO as a result. Gaia and Kronos team both agreed that the synergy will bring different paradigms which eventually set up the partnership.
