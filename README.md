## What is Gaia Proctocol?

Gaia Protocol is an investment-purposed Kalytn network PFP NFT project by combining Defi 2.0 and NFT concepts. The project deposits 50% of all minted Klay permanently on Kronos DAO, the fisrt Defi 2.0 initiative on Klaytn network. The coumpound interest generated from the deposit will be dsitributed to the NFT holders. We have a prospective missioin to create a proacitve community with enthusiasts in both DeFi 2.0 and NFT investment, with inforamtion exchange as well as various internal events exclusively for our community members.

## What is the goal of Gaia Protocol?

The project goal is to make Gaia Protocol a passive income for the holders through receiving interests after they exceeds the break-even point of the initial investment on the project. Gaia Protocol's minting process will embark on February 10th, 2022. Half of the minting price will be staked on Defi 2.0 permanently. Holders can easily claim the interests on the porject website. Due to the importance of compounding interest in Defi 2.0, freqeunt interest claiming may prolong the time needed to reach the break even point of the investment. Another goal of the project is to build a strong and attractive community for the holders. It will become a major community for NFT & Crypto investors for making potential profits through exclusive information sharing amoung the holders. Such an interactive community will be beneficial to members and appreciate the value of Gaia Protocol. The growth of Gaia Protocol community will not only increase the investment on Klaytn network, but also help to expand Klaytn ecosystem eventually.
