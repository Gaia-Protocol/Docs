# Gaia Protocol Fund Distribution and Key Event Dates

{% hint style="info" %}
Warning: Gaia Protocol will consign the fund to [Kronos DAO](https://docs.kronosdao.finance/v/kr/), and the project does not cover any loss due to the fluctuation of Kronos value. Please conduct any necessary researches carefully before the investment.
{% endhint %}

## Minting Date

Minting will start on **February 10th 2022**. At Korean Time 22:00 (UTC + 9), 4,000 NFTs will be available for Pre-sale only for white-listed users. At Korean Time 23:00 (UTC+9), 6,000 NFTs will be available for Public-sale for all crypto investors.

Mint Price: **1,000 Klay**

You can mint 5 NFTs per transaction on Pre-sale, 10 NFTs per transaction on Public-sale.

Whitelist tickets will be provided more than the quota of the pre-sale amount. First-come-first-served principle will be applied on pre-sale as a result.

## Gaia Protocol Fund Distribution

After the mint, the Klay revenue will be distributed to the following fund pools: **Kronos DAO Deposit Fund (50%), Buyback Fund (45%), Dev Fund (5%)**

### Kronos DAO Deposit Fund (50%)

50% of the total minted Klay will be deposited to Kronos DAO (sKRNO). Unless Kronoes DAO terminates the project, the interest will be permanently distributed to NFT holders. Holders can set the interest amount they wish to withdraw and claim it from Gaia's official website. Kronos DAO compounds the interest three times a day (07:04 / 15:04 / 23:04 UTC + 9).

### Buyback Fund (45%)

45% of the total minted Klay and the commission fee from Open Sea (10% Resale Royalty) will be distributed to the Buyback Fund. You can request for the buyback at the mint price from the official website if the first interest is not yet compounded at the DAO Deposit Fund. The first interest will be compounded 3 days after the mint process is completed. If the NFT holders wish to request for the buyback after the first interest is compounded, the buyback amount will be calculated by deducting the accumulated interest from the original mint price and will be paid in Klay. NFTs that the team bought back will be listed on Open Sea and replenish the Buyback Fund. The buyback will be made assuming the holders claimed the interest from the NFT.

Gaia team will become the benchmark of NFT, which will never claim the interests. If the accumulated interest worth exceeds the mint price in Klay, Buyback Fund will not be available for the holders. Instead, the Buyback Funds will be used for V2 project development and expense.

F.Y.I. If a breakeven point is achieved, the team will hold a party for holders offline.

### Dev. Fund (5%)

5% of the total minted Klay will be provided to the Gaia Protocol team for ensuring the stability of project operations and community management. The project team will not get any of the NFTs from the project. No perks will be given during the minting process.
