# Q\&A

## Q: Would there be any benefits by holding Gaia Protocol NFT?

**A: The team will create exclusvie Discord channle for NFT holders. We expect the channel actively exchange qualified investment information which incentivize holders to form strong community. Gaia NFT holders will form strong bond, which will make a virtuous cycle of increase in NFT value, within the community. Gaia team also planning 'breakeven point party' and various on/off-line events for the NFT holders.

**The main difference with other NFT projects is that holders can secure their investment principal (1,000 Klay) as much as possible from the project. Moreover, we will provide a whitelist ticket for the V2 project. There would be no other benefits for the holders until now.**

## Q: Does Kronos DAO APY decide the success of Gaia Protocol?

#### A: Gaia Protocol consigns 50% of total minted Klay to Kronos DAO. APY of Kronos DAO does impact on total period of reaching breakeven point. However, unless Kronos DAO terminate the projects, Gaia NFT holders will receive compounding interest permanenlty. On the other hand, it is hard to say the project is failed since the principal did not collect fully or the total period of breakeven point has increased significantly. The team's standard of sucess is focused on growth of the community.

## Q: I cannot understand Buyback FUnd. What is the difference between selling through Buyback Fund and Open Sea?

#### A: Buyback Fund Operation and Open Sea Trading are separate. If you want to know the concept of Buybck Fund, please refer the previous section. For Buyback, Gaia NFT Holders can request a buyback from the official website. From the buyback procedure, the team will deduct the accumulated compounding interest that was made from the holding period. The Buyback Fund will be operated until the accumulated compounding interest worth reaches 1,000 Klay.

#### Gaia project team will list NFTs bought with Buyback Fund to replenish the fund. Through the such prodcedure we will rund the Buyback Fund much stable. If the trade is made on Open Sea, you cannot get the benefit from Buyback Fund: the trade on Open Sea is made between the NFT collectors. Resale Royalty will be returned to Buyback Fund to support Gaia NFT value.

#### If Bubyback Fund is used all, Bankrun situation can be made. However, the team will hold various events and side projects to secure the project value.

## Q:  When is the Whitelist registration due?

#### A: Dedaline is 23:00 UTC + 9, 8th of February, 2022. You should keep your asset until the minting eventhough the snapshot is made. (The team will doudble check your asset before the minting transcation.)

## Q: Which wallet can we use for the minting and Whitelist registration?

#### A: You can input Meta Mask, Kaikas and Klip (last two wallets are for Klaytn network) to check the NFTs/Tokens for Whitelist registraion. The team will support both Kaikas and Klip for the minting. You don't need to type all three wallets if certain wallet does not have any assets for whitelist. 

## Q: Does 1000 Klay for the minting also count for Whitelist registration? 

#### A: No.
