# Q\&A

## Q: What are the benefits of holding Gaia Protocol NFT?

**A: The team will create an exclusive Discord channel for NFT holders. Members in the channel will actively exchange qualified investment information which incentivizes holders to form a strong community. Gaia NFT holders will form a strong bond, which will in turn form a virtuous cycle to increase the NFT value, within the community. Gaia team is also planning for a 'breakeven point party' and various on/off-line events for our NFT holders.**

#### The main difference with other NFT projects is that holders can secure their investment principal (1,000 Klay) as much as possible from the project. Moreover, we will provide a whitelist ticket for the V2 project for our NFT holders. There would be no other benefits for the holders for now.

## Q: Does Kronos DAO APY decide the success of Gaia Protocol?

#### A: Gaia Protocol consigns 50% of total minted Klay to Kronos DAO. APY of Kronos DAO does impact the total period of reaching the breakeven point. However, unless Kronos DAO terminates the projects, Gaia NFT holders will receive compounding interest permanently. On the other hand, it is not conclusive to claim that the project failed just because the principal amount has not been fully collected by its compounding interest, or the total period of breakeven point has increased significantly. The team's standard of success is focused on prioritizing the growth of the community.

## Q: I cannot understand the Buyback Fund. What is the difference between selling through Buyback Fund and Open Sea?

#### A: Buyback Fund Operation and Open Sea Trading are separated. If you want to know the concept of the Buyback Fund, please refer to the previous section. For Buyback, Gaia NFT Holders can request a buyback from the official website. From the buyback procedure, the team will deduct the accumulated compounding interest that was made from the holding period. The Buyback Fund will continue to operate until the net worth of the accumulated compounding interest reaches 1,000 Klay.

#### Gaia project team will list NFTs bought with Buyback Fund to replenish the fund. Through the procedure, we will be able to sustain the Buyback Fund more stably. There are a few reasons why selling through Buyback Fund is better than through Open Sea: Investors can secure their principals as much as possible by reselling at Buyback Fund, but at Open Sea investor may need to pay for a 10% resale royalty, and would also need to suffer from a potential lower selling price. Resale Royalty will be returned to Buyback Fund to support Gaia NFT value.

#### If Buyback Fund is used entirely, bank run situation can be made. However, the team will hold various events and side projects to secure the project's value.

## Q:  When is the Whitelist registration due?

#### A: Deadline is at 23:00 UTC + 9, 8th of February, 2022. You should keep your asset until the minting stage, even after the snapshot is made. (The team will double-check your asset before the minting transaction, so please keep at least the same amount of asset for minting at least until the minting stage.)

## Q: Which wallet can we use for the minting and Whitelist registration?

#### A: You can use Meta Mask, Kaikas, and Klip (the last two wallets are for the Klaytn network) to check the NFTs/Tokens for Whitelist registration. The team will support both Kaikas and Klip for the minting. You don't need to type all three wallets if a certain wallet does not have any assets for the whitelist.

## Q: Does 1000 Klay for the minting also count for Whitelist registration? 

#### A: No.
